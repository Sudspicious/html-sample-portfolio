        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>Hello everybody, my name is Sudarsanan. I am beginner in everything and I openly 
            say that I'm lazy but damn honest. If I don't like you , I would openly avoid you
            make sure I am open all the time. I am quite like entropy , a lazy entropy to be 
            more precise. I am quite unpredictable and cranky , but if I find anything useful 
            and important for me , I would make sure to do it no matter what , simply similar 
            to learning FULL-STACK Dev here.</p>

        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p>Currently 2nd year in college. <br /> Fortunately I am someone who wants to learn 
            something new everyday and like to develop 1% everyday.

        <h2>Knowledge:</h2>
        <p>I have studied biology in school , studying computer science in college
            and I seem to understand many things easily, and I make sure that I am 
            atleast quite knowledgable in some stuff. I love QUANTUM MECHANICS.
        </p>

            I am planning on doing some jobs or internships side by side to college.
